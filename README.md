# Heroku Custom Domain Tutorial

## Brief Introduction

Hello all. I wanted to make an in-depth guide on getting your deployed heroku application live on a custom domain. Unfortunately, the docs on heroku don't elaborate too well on their custom domain feature, so instead of going on a wild chicken-chase through 20+ websites to figure it out, you have this guide to make it easy!

#### Please note a couple of Things before beginning
- You will need to have your heroku app of choice deployed and live (there are many tutorials for this else-where)
- Custom Domains aren't free! I will be including the steps to purchase a cheap google domain in this guide, so be willing to spend around $10
